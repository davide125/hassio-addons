# Homebridge addon for Home Assistant

This is an [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) add-on for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io). Homebridge provides a lightweight HomeKit API implementation with plugin support.

Note that Home Assistant supports HomeKit natively these days, both as a [controller](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit_controller/) and as a [device](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit/), so you probably don't need Homebridge if you just want to integrate with the HomeKit ecosystem. However, Homebrige has a lot of plugins, so it can still be useful to bridge some less-supported devices (e.g. [Nest](https://github.com/chrisjshull/homebridge-nest)) into Home Assistant.

## Installation
Add the [add-on repository](https://github.com/davide125/hassio-addons) and install Homebridge from the add-on store.

To configure Homebridge click on OPEN WEB UI from the add-on page.

## Credits
This add-on was inspired by [adsb-multi-portal-feeder](https://github.com/MaxWinterstein/homeassistant-addons/tree/main/adsb-multi-portal-feeder) to leverage a pre-existing Docker image and integrate it into an add-on ([Docker Homebridge](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge) in this case). The add-on icon is a downscaled copy of the [official one](https://github.com/homebridge/branding). These projects (and Homebridge itself) deserve all the credit here. This add-on is unrelated to the deprecated [addon-homebridge](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-homebridge).
